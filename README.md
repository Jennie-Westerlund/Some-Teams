Hi, this is our first assignment in PHP and it won’t be graded. Down below you’ll find the requirements for the assignment. 


Requirements:

* The data you will be using is in data.php.

* Your web site should contain a start page and a about page.

* The about page should have information about you, the creator.

* The start page should be constructed with at least three different .php files, and should display the teams listed in data.php. Feel free to list them how you like.

* The project should not print any HTML within PHP strings.

* The project should not include any coding errors, warning or notices.

* The repository should have at least 7 commits and not just one big commit.

* The repository should contain a README.md file with information about the project (usually a README.md includes information about what the project is about, how it's made, about the author, install instructions if any and such stuff)

* The repository should contain a LICENSE file. Preferably MIT.
